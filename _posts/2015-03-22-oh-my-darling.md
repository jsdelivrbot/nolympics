title: Massachusetts, They've Confused Us
---

*To the tune of "Oh my darling Clementine"*

Massachusetts,<br>
they've confused us<br>
with a picture so sublime.<br>
Watch your wallet.<br>
They will want it<br>
in a moment; give them time.<br>

How the traffic<br>
won't be hectic,<br>
how the trains will run on time?<br>
"Transit spending,<br>
already pending"<br>
is their answer everytime.<br>

The distinctions<br>
of the fictions<br>
and the leaks that hid the press:<br>
Hear our voices;<br>
We want choices,<br>
not charades of openness.<br>

A referendum<br>
wouldn't be dumb,<br>
really quite the contrary.<br>
If it's open<br>
we should vote then.<br>
Why not try democracy?<br>

And security,<br>
that's a surety:<br>
The Feds are in control.<br>
Just because it's<br>
different budgets<br>
doesn't mean there's not a toll.<br>

They take pride in<br>
our hard-workin':<br>
"Innovation is a must."<br>
But note the hassle<br>
and they'll say, well<br>
take a break for all August.<br>

Barcelon-er<br>
is another:<br>
Makes them want to point and shout.<br>
Sure the city's<br>
mighty pretty,<br>
but the renters got priced out.<br>

Now when London<br>
went and jumped in,<br>
their first bid was priced like ours...<br>
final budget<br>
didn't quite fit,<br>
neither pounds nor work hours<br>

Their arena:<br>
never seen a<br>
bigger set of tinker toys.<br>
Disassembled,<br>
reassembled:<br>
Are they real, or just decoys?<br>

Massachusetts,<br>
they've confused us<br>
with a picture so sublime.<br>
Watch your wallet.<br>
They will want it<br>
in a moment; give them time.<br>
