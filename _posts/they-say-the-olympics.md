title: They Say the Olympics

*To the tune of "On Top of Spaghetti"*

They say the Olympics<br>
will turn a profit,<br>
except when you look close,<br>
their facts don't quite fit.<br>

<!--more-->

Don't look at Sochi,<br>
and not at Beijing,<br>
and Montreal neither.<br>
You should get the swing.<br>

But those ones don't matter,<br>
that's what they'll tell you.<br>
"America's better."<br>
Let's look at a few.<br>

In 1980,<br>
at Lake Placid,<br>
the hillsides were white,<br>
but they were deep in the red.<br>

So the state of New York<br>
took over the debt<br>
(along with the ski jumps):<br>
It's losing cash yet.<br>

For the '84 'lympics<br>
only two cities ran:<br>
It went to Los Angeles,<br>
but imagine Tehran.<br>

The IOC asked for<br>
brand new stadia.<br>
LA had the leverage<br>
to just tell them "Nah".<br>

Atlanta did OK:<br>
Made money no doubt.<br>
If a logo could fit there<br>
they'd sure sell it out.<br>

Salt Lake had looked desperate,<br>
till Mitt Romney jumped in,<br>
Maybe he'd repeat,<br>
but let's not call him in.<br>

They say the Olympics<br>
will turn a profit,<br>
except when you look close,<br>
their facts don't quite fit.<br>
