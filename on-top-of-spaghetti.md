They say the Olympics
will turn a profit,
except when you look close,
their facts don't quite fit.

Don't look at Sochi,
and not at Beijing,
and Montreal neither.
You should get the swing.

But those ones don't matter,
that's what they'll tell you.
"America's better."
Let's look at a few.

In 1980,
at Lake Placid,
the hillsides were white,
but they were deep in the red.

So the state of New York
took over the debt
(along with the ski jumps):
It's losing cash yet.

For the '84 'lympics
only two cities ran:
It went to Los Angeles,
but imagine Tehran.

The IOC asked for
brand new stadia.
LA had the leverage
to just tell them "Nah".

Atlanta did OK:
Made money no doubt.
If a logo could fit there
they'd sure sell it out.

Salt Lake had looked desperate,
till Mitt Romney jumped in,
Maybe he'd repeat,
but let's not call him in.

They say the Olympics

except when you look close,
